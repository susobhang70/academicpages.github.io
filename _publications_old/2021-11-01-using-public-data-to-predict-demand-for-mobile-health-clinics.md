This paper mainly talks about Machine Learning based approaches to predict demand for mobile health clinics.
In partnership with The Family Van, we utilize historical mobile health clinic demand data and publicly 
available datasets (like bike usage, library usage, weather reports etc.) to predict future demands for specific
locations.
