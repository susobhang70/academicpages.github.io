I am currently a fifth year PhD student in the [StatRL](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html) research group at Harvard University, working with Prof. [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I am currently focusing on designing Bayesian Reinforcement Learning algorithms for Mobile Health interventions through clinical trials. Recently, we developed and deployed the [reBandit](https://github.com/StatisticalReinforcementLearningLab/miwaves_rl_service) algorithm for the MiWaves clinical trial (Mar to May 2024), aimed at reducing cannabis use among emerging adults (ages 18-25).


My past work has dealt with problems in the domain of Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory & Mechanism Design, and Machine Learning, and I have experience applying them to mobile health settings, computational sustainability problems, social problems like security and planning, and adversarial settings.
