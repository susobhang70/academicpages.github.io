I am currently a second year PhD student in the [Teamcore](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/) research group at Harvard University. My research interests broadly lie in the domain of Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory & Mechanism Design, and Machine Learning, and I seek to apply them to computational sustainability problems, social problems like security and planning, and adversarial settings.
